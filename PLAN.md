How to make the app attractive to visitors and make them want to join?

- When a visitor navigates for the first time, we should show a "Discover" page with a list of existing chats.

- The visitor should be able to open existing chats and read the conversation before being signed in. This will incentivize the user to sign in, if they want to contribute to the conversation.

- We should start ourselves some chats for a bunch of popular repos, and create a conversation there, so that new visitors feel there's something of value in the app. If there are no interesting chats already existing when they visit, they probably won't make the extra effort to start the chats themselves. We could start chats for e.g. repos like Supabase, Nextjs, Tailwind, etc and post something useful/relevant related to each repo.

- Should we make chats public by default and focus on this setting?

- Should any signed-in users be able to open chats on repos which they are interested in, even if they are not the owners? Otherwise, the possibility that an owner would even know our app exists, uses it, and makes the effort to start the chat is probably close to zero.
