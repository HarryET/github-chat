### Instructions

To use Github Chat go to the [app](https://harryet.me) and then login. From there you can create a new chat for any repository you have admin permissions on. Or you can find an existing chat to join!

### How we used supabase?

We have used all the features of supabase! They are broken down below with a more in-depth explanation for each.

#### Auth

- Github 0Auth

#### Realtime

The primary function of the app is to have a realtime chat for github repos so we have used realtime to listen for new messages and then update the messages being shown in the chat & feed.

#### Database

All of the data for the app has been store in the Supabase Postgresql database so it can be accessed through the SDKs with row level security enabled.

## Development

### Run

```
yarn dev
```
